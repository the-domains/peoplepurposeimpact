_People Purpose Impact, _a major new international digital magazine, launches
internationally today. The
publication, featuring powerful storytelling and impactful imagery, was born
out of a desire to tell stories about people and share ideas that spark
conversations and inspire not only thought but also action.The announcement was made by **Melissa Mahler,** the publication's Founder,
CEO and Executive Editor.

Ms. Mahler stated**, **"In
covering athletes over the past few years I saw the truth in Nelson Mandela's
words. 'Sport has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire.
It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does.'While _People
Purpose Impact_ goes beyond sports, it's that same premise that we've
embraced."

Former New York Giant and two-time Super Bowl winner Carl Banks helped unveil the inaugural
cover.
